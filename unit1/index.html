  <h1> Fire </h1>
  
  <p> <i> Fire </i> is the rapid oxidation of a material, releasing heat, light, and various reactions based in the materials burned. </p>
  
  <h3> Cool Fire Facts! </h3>
  
  <ol>
    
    <li> It is possible to change the color of <b> fire </b> based solely on the surrounding temperature. </li>
    
    <li> When <b> fire </b> is used to burn away vegetation, the nitrogen in the soil is released into the atmosphere. The reduction in nitrogen causes the soil to lose its fertility. <br/> (Despite this, some plants can be used to restore the lost nitrogen, along with various other methods that have been discovered). </li>
    
    <li> While <b> fire </b> refers to the reaction, combustion, and heat caused; flame refers specifically to the seeable part of <b>fire</b>. </li>
    
  </ol>
  
  <p> With fire being one of the basic elements, it is used in a variety of ways every day jobs and tasks. </p>
  
  <ul>
    
    <li> Fire is used in Chemistry to raise the temperature of elements and compounds, changing their shape and reactions. </li>
    
    <li> Fire can also be used as a lightsource with candles and fireplaces, though not as much anymore since lightbulbs were invented. </li>
    
    <li> Fire is at the source of both smelting and forging, requiring fire to make matrials they work with malleable. </li>
